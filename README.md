## Personal Expense Tracker

A simple C++ console-based application to manage daily expenses.
This project allows users to add, view, update, and delete expense records, with all data saved in a text file for future use.

## Project Overview

The Personal Expense Tracker helps users keep track of their financial activities directly through a terminal interface.
It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and File Handling to make data management efficient and persistent.

## Features

 1.Add a new expense (amount, date, note)
 2.View all saved expenses in a formatted table
 3.Update existing expense details
 4.Delete unwanted records
 5.Automatically save and load data from expenses.txt
 6.Input validation and error handling for a smooth user experience

## Concepts Used

Classes & Objects â€“ For structuring the Expense and ExpenseTracker

Encapsulation â€“ Data and behavior grouped in classes

File Handling (<fstream>) â€“ To save and load expense records

Vectors (<vector>) â€“ To store multiple expense objects dynamically

Formatting (<iomanip>) â€“ To display data in a clean, tabular format

Validation (<limits>) â€“ To handle invalid input safely
